# CIS 195- Notepad App

##Accomplishment
Created a note taking app that takes location into account. The note
includes a title and the note content itself. This app has a tabbed
view where the user can either enter notes or check the locations of
where the notes were taken and change the map type from standard,
satellite, and hybrid. Also included an icon for both retina and
regular display. Once notes are added or deleted from the list they
are added or removed from the map and centers the map based on the
last note location.
